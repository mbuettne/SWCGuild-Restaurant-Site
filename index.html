        <h4>Restaurant Description</h4>
        <p>
            Buettner Brewing is the culmination of years of trial and error in home brewing and cooking. After years
            of family and friends telling him he should be a professional, Buettner Brewing was founded in 2020 by 
            Master Brewer and Head Chef Troy Buettner. And while we have gone pro, stepping through our doors is still
            just like going to a neighbors house! We specialize in providing superior service in a comfortable 
            atmosphere, and of course the best food paired with high quality drinks! Stop by today to see what friends
            and family have been raving about for years!
